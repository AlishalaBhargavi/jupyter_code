This prevents unexpected errors if the function receives a non-list input.  It now *returns* an empty list and prints an error message.  A better alternative might be to `raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list\")` which signals to the calling code that an invalid input was passed.  I've commented out that line, but it's often the *right* way to handle the error.\n",
            "* **`sorted()` vs. `.sort()`:**  The code demonstrates both `sorted()` (which creates a *new* sorted list) and the `.sort()` method (which sorts the list *in place*, modifying the original).  This is essential for understanding the different options available. The `sorted()` function is generally preferred if you need to keep the original list intact.\n",

            "* **Mixed-Type Example (Commented Out):**  I've included a *commented-out* example of a list with mixed data types (numbers and strings).  This is important because sorting such a list will generally raise a `TypeError` in Python 3.  Python 2 would attempt a lexicographical comparison, which could produce unpredictable results.  It's better to handle this explicitly, or ensure that the list only contains comparable elements.\n",
            "* **Comprehensive Comments:**  The code includes thorough comments explaining each step, making it easier to understand.\n",

            "* **Returns a *new* list (for `sorted()`):** The `sort_list` function now explicitly returns a *new* sorted list when using `sorted()`. This prevents unexpected side effects if the user expects the original list to remain unchanged.\n",
            "* **Clearer Output:** The print statements now clearly label the original and sorted lists, making it easy to see the effect of the sorting.\n",
